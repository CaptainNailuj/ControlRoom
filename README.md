-Control room To do list application
    
    The idea is to create a To Do List application, a minimalist looking application that at least meets the following features and characteristics:


User-Friendly Interface:

    Intuitive and easy-to-use design with a clean and clutter-free interface.

Task Management:

    Create and delete tasks quickly.




Style and look of the application

It should have a sober and minimalist appearance that allows the user to easily identify the tools


What are you going to see when you open the application?

just a section with an empty textfield where you can write down your new task.
another section where the task in progress are stored, and beside each one there is a delete button when the task is done.
