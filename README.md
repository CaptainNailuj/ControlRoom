# ControlRoom

-Control room To do list application
    
    The idea is to create a To Do List application, a minimalist looking application that at least meets the following features and characteristics:


User-Friendly Interface:

    Intuitive and easy-to-use design with a clean and clutter-free interface.

Task Management:

    Create, edit, and delete tasks quickly.
    Support for due dates, start dates, deadlines, and recurring tasks.
    Ability to organize tasks into lists or categories for better organization.

Reminders and Notifications:

    Customizable reminders for due dates and times.

Priority and Labels:

    Options for setting task priorities (e.g., high, medium, low) and labels (e.g., work, personal, errands).
    Color-coded tags or labels for easy identification.


Style and look of the application

It should have a sober and minimalist appearance that allows the user to easily identify the tools




What are you going to see when you open the application?

the idea is to have a big board style screen where you can see little labels, you should be capable of changing the size of those labels
and write inside them with a little toolbar where you can change the style of the text

you should be able to move around the labels.

you should be able to set a timer on each label so you get a notification on your screen when the timer meet the deadline.

with just a button you can create new labels.
